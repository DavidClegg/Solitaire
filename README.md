 My attempt at HTML solitaire

Solitaire is a simple card game.

## Rules
The goal is to create a stack of cards from low to high in each of the four foundation piles.

Each pile can only contain one suit.

Aces are low, and kings are high. The four foundation piles being with aces and end with kings.

Below the foundation piles, you can move cards from one column to another. Cards in columns must be placed in descending order and must alternate between red and black. For example, you can put a 7 of hearts on an 8 of clubs.

You can also move sequential runs of cards between columns. Just tap the deepest card in the run and drag them all to another column.

If you ever have an empty column, you can place a king there or any sequential stack with a king at its head.

If you get stuck, tap the deck in the upper-left corner to draw more cards. If you exhaust the deck, you can deal it again by tapping the empty deck space.
